## The Work I Did

I learned what p5.js is and learned how to set up a basic "empty" p5 code sketch. I then created two "Hello World!" sketches and learned how they work. I also was introduced to comments and learned how they function relatively quickly. I also learned how to search and read p5 reference documents. I then learned how to "setup()" and "draw()" and declare these fuctions. I finally learned how to setup a live webpage with my "Hello World!" sketch.

## Steps Taken to Complete the Assignment

- I went through all the coursework for the week so that I could understand what I was doing.
- I drew my first code sketch
- I created a hw-3 folder
- I made a pink canvas
- I declared a "draw()" function and added "Hello World"
- I changed "Hello World!" to "I love you!"
- I set up a live webpage

## Struggles

At a few points I forgot to have spaces in certain areas and it took me a while to figure out. In all honesty that was the only struggle. Everything went relatively smoothly.

## How I Helped Other Classmates

I haven't yet, but that's because I've been incredibly busy with work, classes, and personal struggles.
