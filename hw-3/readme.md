## The Work I Did

I learned wat p5.js is and learned how to set up a basic "empty" p5 code sketch. I then created two "Hello World!" sketches and learned how they work. I also was introduced to comments and learned how they function relatively quickly. I also learned how to search and read p5 reference documents. I then learned how to "setup()" and "draw()" and declare these fuctions. I finally learned how to setup a live webpage with my "Hello World!" sketch.
