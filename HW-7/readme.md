# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

The original code is definitely a conditional flow. The outcome varies depending on the width of the window, for instance if its opened in a smaller window the outcome would be different than that of a larger window (because one of the presets is that the background's width is the window's width). We then had to layout what I will refer to as the presets of the ball. First, out of the ball's presets, was the ball's overall width (which was at 40), this was followed by the ball's x & y positions (which changes where the ball is placed at the start, in the original both are set to 10, however in my edit both are at 20). Next came the delta and scale of the ball (which basically determine how far apart the balls appear, in both pieces all remained set at 1). Then we had to create the canvas (aka the background, both edits (the original and my own) had the same presets, I didn't feel the need to change the canvas's size). Finally, all of the remaining code determines what path the ball takes.


## How did you alter the sketch?

I changed the sketch by making the background violet and coloring the ball cyan, I also made the overall side of the ball smaller, however I didn't change the delta or the scale of the ball because for the most part, every time I did it the outcome was unamusing and before long would be inanimate (from its appearance at least, nothing would be visibly moving) and I wanted it to keep the attention of its audience.
