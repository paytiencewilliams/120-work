# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

The original code is definitely a conditional flow. The outcome varies depending on the width of the window, for instance if it opened in a smaller window the outcome would be different than that of a larger window (because one of the presets is that the background's width is the window's width). 


## How did you alter the sketch?

I changed the sketch by making the background violet and coloring the ball cyan, I also made the overall side of the ball smaller, however I diddn't change the scale of the ball because for the most part, every time I did it the outcome was unamusing and before long would be inanimate (from its appearance at least, nothing would be visibly moving) and I wanted it to keep the attention of its audience.
