## The Work I Did

I learned to create and edit files within repositories on Atom and GitHub. I also learned how to create "commits" on edited files, how to upload those repositories to GitHub.

## Steps Taken to Complete the Assignment

- I created a .txt file (named test1.txt)
- I downloaded Atom
- I downloaded GitHub
- I created a repository and edited files (Specifically README.md and test1.txt and test2.md)
- I created "commits" for the above files
- I then uploaded my reposittory to GitHub
- Finally I started writing my response in a document labeled "readme.md"

## Struggles

My biggest struggle in all honesty was getting this assignment done; there wasn't anything particularly hard about it, but I was incredibly busy with work so that complicated being able to actually do my work; and this my assignment is late.

## What I Learned

I learned how to work with GitHub and Atom, which I had never had any experience using before. It was a lot of fun.

## How I Helped Other Classmates

To be entirely honest this past homework cylce I have been to busy to help out other students.
