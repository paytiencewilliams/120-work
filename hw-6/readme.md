## The Work I Did

I created an interesting piece that evokes a calming yet uncertain emotion, as the winding colors (that resemble smoke) speed up and slow down at any given point. The colors flow well together and resemble that of my emotion at the time of creating this piece. I have chosen to name this piece "Collateral Beauty"

## Steps Taken to Complete the Assignment

- I went through all the coursework for the week so that I could understand what I was doing.
- I read the "algorithmic art" article on wikipedia.
- I used ‘global’ variables
- I devised algorithms with math operators and functions to dictate these evolving relationships 
- I used a random number generator and mapped at least one functions
- Finally, after typing this assignment I used GitHub to upload my work.

## Struggles

I ended up getting very ill and as a result fell behind (specifically in this class) to the point that I'm not sure that if I finished week 4 and 5's projejcts that I'd even get credit. As a result I was incredibly stressed out and struggled coming to grips with the fact that now I have to hurry and get caught back up. I'm still very ill and my nose bled a lot throughout this project so it's a bit worrysome, however, I still finished this week's work, even if it is a bit late... Thank goodness

## What I Learned

I learned that I can use algorithms to make art, which is pretty cool. However, math is not one of my favorite subjects. I got frustrated every now and then when certain pieces wouldn't appear and I would have to rework parts of the entire assignment until all of the bugs were fixed.

## How I Helped Other Classmates

I haven't yet, but that's because I've been incredibly busy with work, classes, illness, and personal struggles.
